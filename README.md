# MultiTag

## Overview

As of now, a user can only search through a tumblr blog by one tag at a time.  How nice it would be to search for posts that contain two or more tags at a time.  That is the goal of this app.

## Implementation

Using Python, Django, and the Tumblr API (so far)

## In Progress

This app is still in the production phase, but anyone is free to look at the code!

The Django site is in the folder mysite, and the app implementation is in views.py.  To see a rough working draft of my app used for test purposes, look at the file test.py
